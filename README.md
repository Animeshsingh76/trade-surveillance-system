# Trade Surveillance & Anomaly Detection System

A real-time trade surveillance dashboard built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Machine Learning-ready architecture** to detect suspicious trading activity.

## 🚀 Features
- Price anomaly detection (statistical threshold based)
- Volume spike detection
- ML-based anomaly flagging
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Sensitivity slider for anomaly detection
- Alert log with rule-based alerts
- Modular architecture (rules, ML, ingestion)

## 🧠 How it Works
1. Trades are generated using synthetic market data
2. Price and volume patterns are analyzed
3. Anomalies are detected using:
   - Standard deviation thresholds
   - Volume spikes
   - ML anomaly scoring
4. Alerts are generated and displayed in real-time
